The plastic containers melted during the incident, releasing the vegetable oil. In addition, located in the laydown yard where the fire occurred, a few containers of seal coat (a petroleum based asphalt coating) also melted. Two fire departments were able to extinguish the fire using aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) and by overhauling the affected infrastructure. Some contamination was contained by creating berms and using a sump to collect the oil/water mixture. Pooled product was collected using absorbent material, a rope mop skimmer, and a vacuum truck. Recovered liquids were stored in a 10,000 gallon storage tank on site for future treatment and disposal.",,https://dec.alaska.gov/Applications/SPAR/PublicMVC/CSP/SiteReport/26896,https://dec.alaska.gov/Applications/SPAR/PublicMVC/CSP/SiteReport/26896,https://drive.google.com/file/d/19cav3FFVTJyuIm1xJDkJjzZ-WDwuh89t/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16YvokKcmihXnebJUplPThGrXqlNiydP4,
