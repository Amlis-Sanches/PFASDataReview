From CDC Paper C1

These substances have been used extensively in surface coating and protectant formulations due to their unique surfactant properties (Kissa PERFLUOROALKYLS 2 1. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH 2001; Schultz et al. 2003).

protectants for paper and cardboard packaging products, carpets, leather products, and textiles that enhance water, grease, and soil repellency (3M 1999; Hekster et al. 2003; Kissa 2001; Schultz et al. 2003), and in firefighting foams (Schultz et al. 2003). Perfluoroalkyls such as PFOA have also been used as processing aids in the manufacture of fluoropolymers such as nonstick coatings on cookware (DuPont 2008; EPA 2008a).

PFAS is used for protectants in:

- Paper
- Cardboard packaging products
- Carpets
- Leather products
- Textiles
- Enhance water grease and soil repellency
- Firefighting foams
