In 1946, DuPont introduced nonstick cookware coated with Teflon PTFE. Today the family of fluorinated chemicals that sprang from Teflon includes thousands of nonstick, stain-repellent, and waterproof compounds called PFAS, short for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances.

3M became its main manufacturer

3M Corporation invented PFOA in 1947 with several other chemical compounds referred to by the company as “C8” because it has eight carbons tied to fluorine. This family of manmade chemicals is known today as PFAS, or “forever chemicals” as they do not break down in the environment.

(6) The yield of polymer was 2.3 parts or 33%.

(7) Example VII Tetrafluoroethylene (4.0 parts) was placed in a container under pressure with 0.1 part silver nitrate and 2.5 parts methyl alcohol, and maintained at 25° C. After a short period a jelly like polymer was formed.

(8) Example VIII Tetrafluoroethylene (4.5 parts) was placed in a container with 0.1 part silver nitrate and 2.2 parts of methyl alcohol under pressure at 25° C.

(9) Polymerization began immediately with the formation of a jelly like mass. In three days this had solidified to a brown powder which had properties similar to those of the white polymer.

(10) The yield was 1.3 parts or 29%.

(11) Example IX Tetrafluoroethylene (7.4 parts) was placed in a container with 0.1 part of silver nitrate and 3.3 parts of methyl alcohol under pressure at 250 C. The yield of the brown polymer was 2.0 parts or 27%.

(12) Example X Tetrafluoroethylene (8.8 parts) was placed in a container with 0.1 part of benzoyl peroxide under pressure at 25° C. The yield of polymer after 21 days was 0.05 part or 0.57%.

(13) Example XI Tetrafluoroethylene (3.5 parts) was placed in a container under pressure at 500 C. Polymerization in this case was more rapid than at lower temperatures.

(14) G. Reaction is not limited to temperature, although the rate of polymerization at temperatures as low as -80° C. is slow. The rate increases with the temperature and this factor may be used to produce higher yields in shorter times. In general, it may be stated that the temperatures and pressures to be employed are limited only by the economics of the process.

(15) H. The polymers of tetrafluoroethylene are white or brown powders or jelles, which are in - soluble in the usual solvents and are inert to the usual chemical reagents. These polymers become incandescent in the presence of a flame but do not burn when the flame is removed, and melt only at red heat. The Polymers are insoluble in hot or cold water, acetone, ether, petroleum ether, ethyl alcohol, isoamyl alcoho , carbon tetrachloride, CzF3C13, dichlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, pyridine, nitrobenzene, 30% NaQE petroleum oil, glacial acetic acid, concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid. .

(16) I. The inertness of this polymer to chemical reagents, its insolubility, and its resistance to heat and to fire make its use desirable in many places. By the use of sufficiently high pressure and temperature it can be molded into articles 0 which are relatively clear and colorless. Such articles are laboratory apparatus for handling corrosive reagents, disks for goggles used in corrosive atmospheres, such as those which pervade certain chemical plants, and the materi :.

(17) may be extruded into fibers which can be used in the manufacture of heat-resistant clothing and the like.

(18) J. As many apparently widely different embodiments of this invention may be made withou 0 departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that I do not limit myself to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.

Claims

1. Polymerized tetrafluoroethylene.

2. The process of polymerizing tetrafluoroethylene which comprises subjecting it to super-atmospheric pressure.

3. The process of polymerizing tetrafluoro- 0 ethylene which comprises subjecting it to super-atmospheric pressure in the presence of a catalyst. ROY J. PLTJNKE TT.
