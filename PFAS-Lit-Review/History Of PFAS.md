July 1, 1939:

Teflon was created by Roy J. Plunkett and patented ("2230544".pn.) by Dupont. Created by

Freezing, a compressed sample of tetrafluoroethylene, he and his associates made an unexpected discovery: The sample had polymerized spontaneously into a white, waxy solid to form polytetrafluoroethylene [(PTFE)](onenote:#What Is a Forever Chemical&section-id={77C190F5-0713-444C-A169-44735F6B888D}&page-id={CAD753AE-4D58-4ACD-9403-2E64F8D792B0}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/5ed39b030e98e961/Documents/Research%20Stories/Forever%20Chemicals.one).

PTFE is inert to virtually all chemicals and considered the most slippery material in existence, making it one of the most valuable, versatile technologies invented.
