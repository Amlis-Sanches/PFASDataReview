# [PFAS Explained From The EPA](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-explained)
EPA is committed to providing meaningful, understandable, and actionable information on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances – known as PFAS – to the American public. The information provided here is intended to explain some of the important background information needed to understand the details of specific actions EPA takes to address PFAS, and other emerging events related to PFAS.

## [PFAS in General](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/epapfasinv)
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) included in EPA’s expanded ToxCast chemical inventory and available for testing. These PFAS chemicals were successfully procured from commercial suppliers (with a small number provided by National Toxicology Program partners) and were deemed suitable for testing (i.e., solubilized in DMSO above 5mM, and not gaseous or highly reactive). All or portions of this inventory are being made available to EPA researchers and collaborators to be analyzed and tested in various high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-throughput toxicity (HTT) assays.  

The [https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/EPAPFAS75S1](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/EPAPFAS75S1) list is a prioritized subset of this larger chemical inventory.  

The [https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/EPAPFASINSOL](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/EPAPFASINSOL) list were chemicals procured, but found to be insoluble in DMSO above 5mM.
