However, these industrial releases have been declining since eight companies began voluntarily phasing out the production and use of several perfluoroalkyls in the early 2000s (3M 2007b, 2008a, 2008b; Barton et al. 2007; Davis et al. 2007; DuPont 2008; EPA 2007a, 2008a, 2016a)

Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA has proposed a significant new use rule (SNUR) for long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (LCPFAC) chemical substances and sulfonates to ensure that the manufacture, import, or processing of LCPFAC chemical substances for any discontinued uses cannot begin without EPA review. EPA essentially excluded the use or import of all LCPFAC chemical substances by proposing a SNUR for LCPFACs and sulfonates (EPA 2015)
